### The Nym Squad is focused on facilitating the formation of squads inside the Nym ecossistem.

## Manifesto

We’ve gathered together because of our love for privacy, technology and Nym. The Nym project is a privacy focused web3 project with a mixnet as it’s main product, we believe that Nym’s mixnet is the future of privacy and in order to help build this future we would want to facilitate the building process around it through the power of communities.

We are committed to share our knowledge of Nym’s technologies and facilitate the creation of squads with a wide range of acting areas. From activism to software development and infrastructure operation, we believe that company is essential to privacy and we aim to increase the number of use cases of the mixnet through the formation of these squads and therefore increase the privacy of the mixnet itself.
